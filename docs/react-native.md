# Documentation React Native

Complete documentation of the installation and usage of Keen-Slider for React Native. For the documentation of the **web version** click [here](https://keen-slider.io/docs).

## Getting started

The usage of this library is really simple and is explained in many [code examples](https://keen-slider.io/examples). You can add it to any JavaScript or Typescript project you are working on in several way.

### Installation

Install keen-slider from npm.

```
npm install keen-slider
```

### Usage

The library comes with a hook for react-native. Like any react hook, `useKeenSliderNative` has to be called at the top level of your component. Optionally, you can pass [`Options`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#options) and [`Event hooks`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#event-hooks) as first argument. [`Plugins`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#plugins) can be passed as second argument. The hook returns the [`slider instance`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#properties).

```javascript
import { useKeenSliderNative } from 'keen-slider/react-native'

export default () => {
  const slides = 4
  const slider = useKeenSliderNative({
    slides,
  })

  return (
    <View {...slider.containerProps}>
      {[...Array(slides).keys()].map(idx => {
        return (
          <View key={idx} {...slider.slidesProps[idx]}>
            <Text>Slide {idx}</Text>
          </View>
        )
      })}
    </View>
  )
}
```

## Options

To customize keen-slider to your needs there are a lot of options which are listed below. Also the [`Event hooks`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#event-hooks) are part of these options. If you want to change the options after initialization, you can do that with the update function. See [`Properties`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#properties).

### `defaultAnimation`: **object**

Sets the default animation of the functions `moveToIdx`, `next` and `prev`.

- `duration`: **number** - Duration of the animation in milliseconds.
- `easing`: **function** - Easing of the animation as (`time`: **number**) => **number**.

### `drag`: **boolean**

Enables or disables mouse and touch control. Default is **true**

### `dragSpeed`: **number | function**

Set the speed that is applied to the slider when dragging it. Number can be passed as a value or function. Minus values would invert the swipe direction. Default is **1**

### `initial`: **number**

Sets the index of the initially visible slide. Default is **1**.

### `loop`: **boolean | object**

Enables or disables carousel/loop functionality of the slider. This option can also be an object where you can set the `min` and/or the `max` index of the carousel.

Defaults to **false**.

### `mode`: **'snap' | 'free' | 'free-snap'**

Sets the animation that is applied after a drag ends. Default is **'snap'**.

### `range`: **object**

Regardless of the slide number, you can define the range of accessible slides.

- `min`: **number** - sets minimum accessible index
- `max`: **number** - sets maximum accessible index
- `align`: **boolean** - aligns the maximum position to the end of the last slide

### `rtl`: **boolean**

Changes the direction in which the slides are positioned, from left-to-right to right-to-left. Default is **false**.

### `rubberband`: **boolean**

Enables or disables the rubberband behavior for dragging and animation after a drag. Default is **true**.

### `slides`: **object | number | function**

Specifies the configuration of the slides. Every time there is an update, resize or change of options, the slide configuration is renewed. Therefore, all functions are called again. Default is **null**.

- **number** - Sets the number of slides to the specified number.

- **object** - Specifies the slides configuration with an object of optional properties.

  - `origin`: **'auto' | 'center' |Â number** - Sets the origin of the slides. **'auto'** - Adjusts the origins of all slides, so that the first slide aligns left and the last one right. **'center'** - Centers the slides. **number** - Relative to the viewport. Default is **'auto'**.
  - `number`: **number | function | null** - Behaves analog to `slides` if the value is a **number** or **null**. Can be a function as well, that returns a **number** or **null**. Default is **null**.
  - `perView`: **number | function** - Determines what size the slides should be in relation to the viewport/container. Can be a function as well, that returns **number**. Default is **1**.
  - `spacing`: **number | function** - Defines the spacing between slides in pixel. Can be a function that returns a number. Default is **0**.

- **function** - Specifies the slides configuration with a function that returns an array of slide configurations. A slide configuration has the following optional properties:

  - `origin`: **number** - Determines where the origin of a slide is within the viewport. Default is **0**.
  - `size`: **number** - Determines the relativ size of the slide in relation to the viewport. Default is **1**.
  - `spacing`: **number** - Defines the space to the next slide in relation to the viewport. Default is **0**.

  The function receives as first argument the container size.

### `vertical`: **boolean**

Changes the direction of the slider from horizontal to vertical. Default is **false**.

## Event Hooks

Event hooks are function that the slider calls during its lifecycle. The functions getting the [`Properties`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#properties) as the only argument. Event hooks are part of the [`Options`](https://keen-slider.io/docs/react-native#options) and can be specified in the same way.

Below are the event hooks and when they are triggered:

`animationStarted` - Animation was started. An animation takes place after the drag has ended or when calling `moveToIdx()` or `animator.start()`.

`animationStopped` - Animation was stopped.

`animationEnded` - Animation has ended.

`created` - Slider was created.

`layoutChanged` - onLayout was called on the container.

`detailsChanged` - The `details`-property has changed. At each movement, after an option change, and at each initialization or resizing.

`dragged` - Slider was dragged.

`dragStarted` - Drag has started.

`dragChecked` - Direction of dragging was checked and is valid.

`dragEnded` - Drag has ended.

`slideChanged` - Active or most visible slide has changed.

`updated` - the update function was called due to a size change or other trigger

## Methods & Properties

Whether the slider is implemented with a react hook or plain javascript, it returns an instance or an object of properties for further actions. These properties are described below:

- `options`: **object** - Specifies the new options with which the slider should be reinitialized. Default **undefined**.

- `idx`: **number** - Sets the current active slide to the given index. Default **undefined**.

## Plugins

To make it easier to integrate, structure, and version custom slider functions, you can create plugins. Keen-Slider itself is also partially based on plugins.

A plugin is basically a function that receives the slider instance as its only argument and is initiated during slider startup. With the `on` and `emit` function it can take part in the slider lifecycle.

Example:

```typescript
const slider = useKeenSliderNative(
  {
    slides: 4,
  },
  [
    slider => {
      slider.on('created', () => {
        alert('Hello World')
      })
    },
  ]
)
```
